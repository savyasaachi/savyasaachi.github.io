--- 
After a long gruelling day, a day full of disappointment<br/>
I still wear a big smile and can barely contain my excitement.<br/>
For I am on a journey to paradise<br/>
The only land where my spirits rise<br/>
And though here I see the same stars and the moon<br/>
The wind always whistles a peculiar little tune.<br/>
The leaves rustle in rhythm and the birds chirp my song.<br/>
Music surrounds me and I can hum all day long.<br/>
Here I am a child again; there is no reason to worry<br/>
This is my safe haven where everything is mine, every nook and cranny<br/>
And when such a beautiful land smiles for me every single time<br/>
How am I to help my spirits from rising and making up this silly rhyme!<br/>
As the train chugs into the platform, I <br/>
put down my pen<br/>
Because I am home, to be a princess again.<br/>
