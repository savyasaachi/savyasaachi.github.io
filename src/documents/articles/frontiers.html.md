--- 
Some days one is surrounded by faces and names, <br/>
and one is not aware of what to do.<br/>
Some days there is a calm quietness that dissolves all languages<br/>
And there are troubles paralyzing the mind.<br/>
Against all the crusades to bleed out the silence<br/>
To reap a riot of articulation when nothing is required.<br/>
And some days, days such as these <br/>
Are meant for running away, outside the prosaic clamour.<br/>
For words, words, meaning and boundaries;<br/>
There is a need to be in a place where solitude cannot be erased<br/>
And the humiliation that comes when words are forced out of us<br/>
Is understood without risking respect<br/>
These words don’t come whenever I open the door.<br/>
These words happen when I don’t look.<br/>
Everything as a result is a search for the words,<br/>
which fall into pits of darkness when you are not looking;<br/>
And which go away when not let out, <br/>
Banging behind closed doors – <br/>
Which opens but not for anyone who has owned me – <br/>
But for the things that cannot be locked in a cellar<br/>
Or stored in glass jars.<br/>
