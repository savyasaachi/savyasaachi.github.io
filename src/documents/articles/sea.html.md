--- 

I stepped inside and stopped for a second.<br/>
A second to take it all in, <br/>
A second to take a look, <br/>
A second to read the pages.<br/>

What lay ahead was a sea, <br/>
A sea of lies, <br/>
With truth on rapidly sinking stones, <br/>
Sinking in the sea, <br/>
The sea of lies. <br/>

Boats of honesty and those of trust, <br/>
And boats of love and those of loyalty<br/>
Capsized in the sea, <br/>
The sea of deceit, <br/>
The sea of lies.<br/>

A sky of presence and greed and avarice<br/>
Watched over the sea, <br/>
The sea of evil, with no lighthouse, <br/>
The sea with water ever so fickle, <br/>
The sea of lies, and the sea of lies.<br/>

With a fake smile and more masquerade, <br/>
I drowned the sinking stones<br/>
And walked on the sea, <br/>
The sea of fa√ßade, <br/>
The sea of lies, and the sea of lies.<br/>
