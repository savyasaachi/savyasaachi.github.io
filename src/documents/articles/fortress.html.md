Rani had dozed off again on her textbook. This time it was a diagram of hirudinaria staring up at her. She attempted to read the lines below it but all she saw was blur. Her eyelids were slowing, succumbing to gravity. 

Realising it was pointless Rani decided to go to bed. It was only 11 o'clock; she could still hear the TV blaring from the hall.

She slowly climbed on to the cot. Her mother had recently changed the sheets and the crisp smell of Surf-scented bedsheets was so inviting.

Carefully, Rani tucked in the mosquito curtain to the sides of her bed. She had formed her own palace - protecting her from evil, where she was the queen. She inspected the field for intruders and found one buzzing right beside her left ear. Squish! The sense of power one gets when they see a blood sucking monster become a pulp of black and red was amazing.

She relaxed.Tonight was going to be a peaceful one, she had a good  feeling about it.

After covering herself with her cozy blanket, Rani adjusted her pillow and rested her head on it and closed her eyes. Bliss!

She drifted off into her world ... Thinking of what happened in school… what might happen tomorrow… hmmm… 

The door creaked open. Rani opened her eyes to see the face of her 10 yr old sister Rashmi through the holes of her pink mosquito curtain.

She was a sweet but was sometimes annoying.

Good night! Rashmi said Then with a smirk on her face, Rashmi asked "Don't you want to pee?"

Rani could feel her detrusor muscle beginning to contract. She ran to to the toilet in fear that her palace will be destroyed...
