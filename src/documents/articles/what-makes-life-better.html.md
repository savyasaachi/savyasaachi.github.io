title: What makes life better?
--- 
Life is a mixture of flowers and thorns. It is neither a collection of difficulties nor a set of victories. One can be successful in life only when he is ready to accept this reality. Though we desperately want to be free from all kinds of suffering, we have no other option but to accept the problems that come our way. If you want to experience the beauty of dawn, you have to pass through the dark hours of night.

Life becomes a complete circle only when it is a combination of joys & sorrows, tears & smiles and blessings & curses. Difficulties ought to be considered the sauce of life as they make life more enjoyable, just as we know that the stars shining in the sky become more attractive when it is completely dark. The process of progress and development that is happening around us such as agriculture, architecture etc. is only because man has faced the challenges on his way.

The best method to face our problems is to be optimistic in life. Optimism involves finding out the goodness in everything and having a positive outlook. Under all circumstances, strongly believe that everything happens for the best. If you carry on, one day something good will happen, and you will realize that it would not have been possible without the previous disappointment.

Optimism is active; the readiness to work hard and make sacrifices is the most outstanding characteristic of an optimistic person. A pessimist will look at a challenge and say, ‘It is possible, but difficult.’ But an optimist will look at the same and say, ’It is difficult, but possible.’

One of the important qualities that we find in optimistic people is that they are able to set aside all the unnecessary anxieties and live in the present moment. They do not allow their tensions to rule them and destroy their lives. They realize that they can bring about a change in life only by doing something practical. We should have a strong belief that every hurdle has a solution. Analyze it, find out a solution and do everything possible to get out of it. 

Have strong faith in God; those who stay faithful will surely find it easy to handle the presence of problems. Such a person feels that he is not alone, but has the support and guidance of the Creator, in dealing with the problems. This undying trust in a loving Father makes him courageous and optimistic. For him, every problem will turn out to be a challenge where he has to exhibit his inner power.
