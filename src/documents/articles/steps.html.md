Expressing oneself is an art. <br/>
An art performed differently by each individual. <br/>
Some sing, some paint, some write and most love to dance. <br/>
Dance when you are broken.<br/>
Dance when you have your bandage ripped off.<br/>
Dance in the middle of the fighting.<br/>
And most of all, dance when you are perfectly free. <br/>
It gives nothing back – <br/>
no paintings to show on walls,<br/>
no poems to be printed and sold, <br/>
no degrees to hold… <br/>
nothing but that single fleeting moment when you feel alive.<br/>

The moment you could escape to another place <br/>
to vacate yourself from reality, <br/>
to express yourself as the true you… <br/>
more beautiful, more powerful.<br/>

Nobody cares if you cannot dance well. <br/>
Just get up and dance! <br/>
Great dancers are great because of their passion.<br/>

We being medicos, let us read and dance in excess <br/>
– these two delights shall never do any harm to the world.<br/>
