title: The man in the black robe
--- 
Do you remember the man in a long black robe<br/>
Wearing a tall black hat with the secret tricks inside?<br/>
The one who left the children awestruck. <br/>
The one who'd made us believe that people make wonders!<br/>
I see THAT magician today.<br/>
I see him in that "God" playing the veena like her fingers were meant for it.<br/>
In the one dancing on stage like he has infinite packets of energy in his body. <br/>
In him who blends the colors like they were waiting to be on the canvas; <br/>
in him who leaves the OT in bliss of having saved someone's breath, <br/>
in that player smashing the TT ball like the world ended on that table, <br/>
that lady swimming like she is the queen of oceans. <br/>
In her who has tears of love for someone.<br/>

Imagine what the world would be like if it realised<br/>
that it could be the man in the black robe?!<br/>
I want to be in that world, to be the man in the black robe, <br/>
to spend all the energy on a magic trick!<br/>
