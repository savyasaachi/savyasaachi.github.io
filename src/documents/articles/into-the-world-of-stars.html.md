title: Into the world of stars
--- 
She stepped out of earth with a crew<br/>
Twinkling eyes reflected earth's view!<br/>
Daughter of Indian soil among the few,<br/>
With an invincible fire to achieve!<br/>

She became one of the great seven<br/>
Into the space shuttle Columbia to heaven<br/>
Strapped her seat with satisfaction<br/>
Felt proud that she was an Indian<br/>

She worked in the space satellite<br/>
Floated in space with delight<br/>
First Indian woman astronaut<br/>
Stayed 360 km away for a fortnight!<br/>

To return back, all were eager<br/>
11 seconds to meet their dear!<br/>
Alas! They were engulfed by a haze of fire!<br/>
Their dream to come back was about to shatter...<br/>

Fiery end of Columbia was severe!<br/>
"Columbia is lost!" was printed there<br/>
As frontline in Washington newspaper<br/>
But whole of India saluted her<br/>

Had she lived on.... Who knows?<br/>
To her, the indian flag bows...<br/>
It would flap on Mars..<br/>
But Kalpana became a sparkling star!<br/>
