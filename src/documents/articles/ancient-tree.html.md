--- 
We gathered around the ancient tree<br/>
For knowledge was being imparted<br/>
Men of liquid worth were being made<br/>
They were being poured into rigid moulds,<br/>
Of blinded order, toil and loyalty, but their souls;<br/>
Oh their souls  though, still cried to be free.<br/>

Oh mighty Creator of being, set me free,<br/>
Let me taste the unknown, and sing in glee<br/>
Propagate the change that will multiply my kind,<br/>
And we will fly<br/>
Unimpeded, unarmed by cruel cries<br/>
Of these cold jeweled holy lies.<br/>

We walked further in time<br/>
Like young blind children in a chained line,<br/>
Moving aimlessly at the sound of a distant success chime.<br/>
Yet, how high could a man climb?<br/>
While dunes of memories wither by<br/>
The ever-inclining road to the unseen afterlife.<br/>

I want to stop now, by a quiet small town,<br/>
It is called the Land of Present, Today and this Hour.<br/>
Its vast green meadows ring<br/>
the bells of my ambition.<br/>
I have waited all night dry<br/>
For the tender care of its soft drizzling shower.<br/>

What have I been running after?<br/>
Where is it that I want to reach?<br/>
Not another puzzling state of mind,<br/>
And force myself to succumb <br/>
To the songs of this ancient wisdom,<br/>
Oh lukewarm humankind.<br/>

Doesn't this congregation of noble men survive<br/>
on the beds of inequalities?<br/>
And we die trying to reach the far land in time,<br/>
where the skies meet the earth,<br/>
To bear children in the wilderness of equalities.<br/>
But I will not follow you!<br/>

I will instead cry:<br/>

Oh angels of my quiet side,<br/>
Allot me the genuine gentle skills<br/>
And I will play a tune far ahead<br/>
It will closely knit the sky<br/>
To the thick, beefy branches of the earth.<br/>
And we will remain as one forever,<br/>
Right here and right now,<br/>
Around this sacred Ancient Tree.<br/>
