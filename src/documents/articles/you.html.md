You are my everything<br/>
My heart, my soul<br/>
When things were all wrong<br/>
You brightened it up with your song…<br/>

Each day with you, <br/>
Is as fresh as dew<br/>
And if there is anything I want from life<br/>
Is all the happiness in your life.<br/>

If given a chance to live again, <br/>
I would trace my steps with you again, <br/>
The laughs, fights and pranks…<br/>
Uff! I’m out of words again.<br/>

More the time I spend with you<br/>
The more I want to be with you<br/>
Time and again, the way you say ‘I love you’<br/>
Just makes me fall more in love with you!<br/>

You mean so much to me, <br/>
More than words can ever say<br/>
You are my everything, Dear<br/>
I could never have asked for more, I swear!<br/>
