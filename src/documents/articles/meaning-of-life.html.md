title: The Meaning of Life
--- 
Over Twenty years and<br/>
Thousands of bucks on books, <br/>
I crammed so hard<br/>
But now know nothing;<br/>
It felt like all my time was<br/>
Spent on Studying.<br/>
I studied on weekdays, <br/>
I studied on holidays;<br/>
All I feel I had done was studyâ€¦<br/>
But when I look back now, <br/>
I remember playing, and I remember losing;<br/>
I remember laughing, I remember crying;<br/>
But I can hardly remember studying.<br/>

Years henceforth, <br/>
I might work, I might earn,<br/>
I might save and I might build;<br/>
But when my time comes, <br/>
My memories will be that of the days<br/>
I spent thinking of what I want to do; <br/>
The evenings that I spend<br/>
Just gazing at a tree for hours;<br/>
Or those aimless night strolls<br/>
Just for a breath of fresh air;<br/>
Internalizing and just existing<br/>
As a being<br/>
Is the highest order of my life<br/>
And maybe that is the meaning<br/>
Of my life.<br/>
