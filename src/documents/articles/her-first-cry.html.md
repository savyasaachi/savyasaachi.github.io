title: Her First Cry
---

There he stands <br/>
Waiting for the birth of his child<br/>
A face not seen<br/>
Yet dearly loved.<br/>

For whom plans were ready,<br/>
For whom life was to be lived<br/>
With infinite thoughts in his mind<br/>
Excitement, desire and hopes.<br/>

The wait was probably over <br/>
For the sweet sound he finally heard<br/>
Like A hundred chirping birds<br/>
& the ringing temple bells<br/>
-Her first cry!<br/>

Proud he was of his bold and beautiful wife<br/>
Brushing aside her tresses<br/>
He could barely hold on to the tears<br/>
That ran down his cheek while he carried his new angel!<br/>
The endearing bundle of magnanimous joy,<br/>
The twinkle from her half-closed eyes<br/>
The warmth she gave when he cuddled her,<br/>
 Arousing the protector in him<br/>
As her loving fingers curled around his,<br/>
And finally her smile that lit up his world..<br/>
The dawn of a new era, a date<br/>
He would remember for eternity…….\<br/>
