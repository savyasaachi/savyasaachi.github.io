title:  Transfiguring the MMC Life  
--- 
My journey in this alien world began that August. I was quite excited, yet anxious, about all the changes around me, never expecting that most of the changes would be from within. Me, a person who confidently believed that no variation would transform my view on life. But life, ‘the perfect teacher’, proved me wrong. So here are some such lessons I learned: 

Support each other - Those of us with no sibling, hailing from nuclear families, are utterly joyful when they start living with so many people under the same roof sharing a single hostel kitchen, with all our akkas/ dis/ sirs. Hostel life teaches you to make yourself and people around you happy. The support you get during exams is simply awesome. It is as though the entire hostel is having internals, everybody helping each other out, pumping confidence into our collective hearts: the chats with roommates, soaking up each other’s problems and consoling when the thunderstorms blast out the electric supply to the building.

Value of water – We never know the real value of anything unless it disappears from your sight.  I used to waste gallons of water, but now, I run to save every single drop. This has been due to primary and secondary causes.

Primarily, due to the increased population in the city of Mysore during Dussera or due to the obstruction to flow in the pipes. Secondary reasons include electricity scarcity or problems in the pump. Now I know why our ancestors used to worship so many Gods (God of Rain, God of Electricity, etc.), because nothing gets done otherwise. 

Combined studies – It helps a lot (after editing the unwanted discussions in between, i.e., 90% of the total time spent) especially during exams as you recall some incident where a friend cracked a PJ about that topic, launching into a flowchart of memories.

Being independent -  Shopping in MORE Megastore, getting the things you listed, learning to bargain and getting cursed at for over-bargaining most of the time. 

Multi-tasking - Listening to music, completing the record, chatting and texting friends, munching on snacks, while talking to your roommates – all at the same time. No wonder I take two hours to complete a job that takes my friend 20 minutes. But doing everything at once, or trying to, is what adds spice to life.

Cooking – A task I’d one made up my mind never to try, not out of laziness but because of my fear to light the stove. But now, I’d rather turn chef than starve or live with atrophied taste buds.

Importance of life – Life is short, but every day is special because it adds something. In some way, the things I learnt in my postings, my conversations with different people made me realize the true worth of life and how blessed we are. Now I don’t feel so alien to this world anymore. It’s a metamorphosis required for us to turn into strong, independent, responsible beings.
