“You can no longer stay with me; <br/>
The outside world is there to see.”<br/>
These were the words God told me, <br/>
Before abandoning and sending me here.<br/>

The world, He said, was nothing like Heaven;<br/>
It was more like a Hell I have never seen.<br/>
But, He told me, one little thing, <br/>
that it was a place I never wanted to be in.<br/>

I entered crying, fearing the worst, <br/>
But saw a smile, the sincere most,<br/>
To whom did it belong,<br/>
 I never knew;<br/>

The owner of that smile, <br/>
walked with me every mile, <br/>
taught me what was right and wrong, <br/>
in every other way I’d want.<br/>

Entered new people, into my life<br/>
with whom I spent, day and night<br/>
But I did experience something, <br/>
which I never felt when she was around, <br/>
A feeling called Loneliness.<br/>

Often did my words and actions hurt her, <br/>
But never did she even stir<br/>
I did wonder, whether she’d feelings, <br/>
But deep inside she knew, someday I’d realize.<br/>

As days passed and I grew up, <br/>
The distance between us deepened, <br/>
Since I had reasoned, <br/>
It was uncool to be pampered and cared for.<br/>
She complained not even once, <br/>
When I termed her care as interference;<br/>
But it took me all these years to realize, <br/>
All that she had to sacrifice.<br/>

Now I know, why God sent me, <br/>
One thing He had hid from me.<br/>
His best creation was her, <br/>
And the luckiest person, me<br/>
Because He had made sure<br/>
That she was entirely for me.  <br/>
