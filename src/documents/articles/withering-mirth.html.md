A silent darkness lingered about<br/>
as the melody of the winds seem muted.<br/>
Fear, stealthily paved its way;<br/>
Nevertheless I bravely stayed rooted.<br/>

Time flew faster than before<br/>
for my doom didn’t seem too far;<br/>
the time my bright flames would fade away<br/>
leaving behind just a sooty sear.<br/>

Sadness and dismay weren’t that profound<br/>
A fairly complete life, I thought<br/>
for I had served my sole purpose,<br/>
aided others with the light they sought.<br/>

I looked all around, expectantly<br/>
praying I’d find but another soul<br/>
Aghast, I flickered despite no winds<br/>
helpless and losing self-control<br/>

I wondered what happened to them all<br/>
Not even a trace was left behind<br/>
They’d be there throughout my life I was sure<br/>
Or perhaps t’was a belief that was blind.<br/>

Yielding to the golden flames of my past,<br/>
I was amazed at what I was.<br/>
A boisterous candle as vibrant as ever;<br/>
glowing vigorously without a pause.<br/>

Standing around me were my dear comrades,<br/>
All ablaze with an intimate zeal;<br/>
to fend for others at the time of their need<br/>
or so they made me feel.<br/>

Desperate for answers, I searched deep within<br/>
and saw myself, young and spirited.<br/>
Content with friends and a charming low<br/>
By heck, my life seemed riveted.<br/>

All in all, my past seemed perfect.<br/>
Exuberance filled my cup of life<br/>
but not for long did the joy remain<br/>
for stabbed I was, by truth’s cruel knife.<br/>

Glimpsing into the mirror of candour<br/>
a bolt from the blue I felt.<br/>
A cold shiver ran down my spine<br/>
as the lucid truth was upheld.<br/>

Alone I stood in the perspicuous mirror;<br/>
surrounded by sheer murkiness<br/>
despite the pressure of flames around<br/>
that shone out of mistaken benevolence.<br/>

All of a sudden, awareness dawned<br/>
as I glared at my peer light-givers<br/>
who one-by-one started to fade away<br/>
leaving me in agonized slivers<br/>

My fragile mind was beyond fragmented<br/>
Melancholy choked my girth;<br/>
‘Life is meaningless,’ I said to myself<br/>
as I conceded to the withering mirth.<br/>

Wanting no more of this spiteful life<br/>
I succumbed to the ether’s lord<br/>
My flaming head was put at once<br/>
and my body’s peace was restored<br/>
