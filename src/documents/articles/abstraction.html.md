title: Abstraction
---
They are but fragments of our imagination; <br/>
Abstract clouds in our mind’s eye, <br/>
Making patterns in the kaleidoscope of life.<br/>
Silently the senses, abandon their defenses, <br/>
Escalating into realms of unknown pleasure, <br/>
An ecstasy for the soul, somnolence for the mind.<br/>
It’s a drop of water in the heart of a fire;<br/>
A paradise in the midst of a desert, <br/>
With rippling brooks reflecting over desires.<br/>

Seen by some and hidden by none, <br/>
It remains what it is, until attained by one, <br/>
The illusion shall vanish when the longing is undone.<br/>
