She cried, her body writhed in pain, <br/>
Her screams, dulled by the rain…<br/>
She prayed, tears welled up in those lovely eyes...<br/>
Tears of love, tears of sacrifice…<br/>
And then she was born, <br/>
Tiny, delicate like the dew of early morn…<br/>
She was the joy of the mother’s life…<br/>
She was the force, which kept the mother alive…<br/>
The lovely eyes filled with care, <br/>
The trembling lips touched the tiny forehead…<br/>
“O dear, my little princess”, said she<br/>
“No force shall separate us, my beauty.<br/>
“I promise to protect you, from the storm,<br/>
And keep you, safe and warm…<br/>
Never fear, my dear, for mother’s here<br/>
And everything’s gonna be right, my sunshine…<br/>
