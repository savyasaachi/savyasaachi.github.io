We are a new destiny <br/>
A new world in our own time<br/>
Where the twisted are the lords<br/>
And the angels are the slaves<br/>
Burn our own life for the demons inside <br/>
We are<br/>
Our own heroes, our own villains<br/>
In this story of deaths of the millions<br/>

Say what you might, think what you will<br/>
They are not gonna stop and still kill <br/>
Drink, smoke or pop a pill<br/>
This nightmare lives on but still<br/>
We fight our own battles<br/>
We are<br/>
Our own heroes, our own villains<br/>
In this word of fake messiahs and perverted preachers<br/>

Survive this virtualization<br/>
Survive this dirty charade of high politics<br/>
Where the pigs fly and the crows croon<br/>
The prostitutes dictate and the brothels preach<br/>
Learn the lesson which they teach<br/>
We are<br/>
Our own heroes, our own villains <br/>
In this opera of the diseased and the corrupted saints<br/>
