Shh.<br/>
Close your eyes<br/>
Breathe in<br/>
Listen - <br/>
\- and you’ll hear<br/>
The rain on the windowpane<br/>
The rustle of leaves<br/>
The waves on the sand<br/>
The birds in the morning fluttering about<br/>
The rough and sharp crumpling of paper<br/>
The melody that soothes your veins<br/>
Eternalize it.<br/>

Now look - <br/>
\- and you’ll see<br/>
The drops finding their way down the window<br/>
The green hue around, it’s familiarity<br/>
The waves reaching in to caress the sand<br/>
The pleasant birds in the trees<br/>
The clean sheet of paper you’re about to fill.<br/>

Stop there.<br/>
Take it all in.<br/>
Remember that even when all seems impossible<br/>
All you have to do is pay a little attention<br/>
There is always an escape.<br/>
