desc: Is there a way to stop gender inequality?

title: The Oppressed Majority
--- 
At the outset, let us laud ourselves for being a society that has devised deviant and ingenious ways to violate a woman. We are a brilliant collective mind capable of anything and clearly we are taking that literally. “Swooping down to new lows” with every passing day, if I may be allowed the liberty of using that phrase. 

A warm welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to a society, where nearly half of it is systematically dehumanized in the most surreptitious and the most explicit ways. “The fairer sex” and “the oppressed majority” are synonymous here. In fact, “oppressed” delivers a very cushy blow to the entire culture. 

Women in the present century should learn to accept the fact that feminism is somehow losing its importance - specifically, when it comes down to their bodies. Their bodies are not theirs, they belong to the society, and society does as society pleases; so good luck going against that.

Being a female these days places you in a very unique position. By “you”, God forbid, no one means you as a person; they mean you as an object, your body as their plaything. Dehumanization does not even crop up in the whole equation, for there was never a person there to begin with.

From the swinging culture of body shaming to a gross violation of their being, females are subjected to everything possible in the so-called spectrum. They are raped, abused, tortured, pushed into prostitution, sexual slavery and every other thing that our resplendent minds can come up with. This, although, is just one extreme. The other is just extinguishing their existence altogether at the moment of their birth or conception. In between the two, we have a multi-tiered approach to dealing with them, which dishes out molestation, harassment, eve-teasing and what not, in equal measure. But we have to admit the sagacity of the system, in that we dole it out to each and every one of them, one or the other thing, in abundance. 

But we can’t take the blame silently, can we? We are taught from the commencement of our life that they are an inferior being and their only purpose in life is being an article to derive pleasure from  or do as you please. They are a property, if lucky, of their father, brother or husband and if not, then of any random fellow passing on the street whose fancy they strike. 

We are, unfortunately, part of a civilization where women are cleverly marginalized in the most myriad of ways and till the time this stays, ladies, you are on your own in your personal, gilded prison.
