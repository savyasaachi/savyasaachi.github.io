To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and to never stop fighting. These are not my words. But is this not the crisis we face daily? 

Always in a constant urge to be someone who would be loved by everyone, pretending be happy when you have been struck with the greatest misfortune, liking something which you dislike the most. Those moments when you have actually felt the opposite: suicidal.

Shakespeare once said, “God has given you one face and you make yourself another.”

Most people are ‘other people’ living a life of constant duplicity.

You are losing originality; worse, you are losing yourselves!

Putting up one face for yourself and another to people will finally confuse you as to which one is true.

You are born original. Then why try to be someone you are not?
Why should your thoughts be rooted in someone else’s opinion? Why should your life be a play?

Have the courage to be what you really are. Let the mark go off your face and let the world know the ‘real’ you and not the one you think you should be.

Be YOURSELF to eventually become better.
