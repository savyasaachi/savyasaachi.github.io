title: Terror in the Eyes of God
--- 
He hunts the weak and drinks their blood<br/>
blessings of curses, deliverance of pain<br/>
To be his slaves is all he craves<br/>
Still greedy for all the souls he gains<br/>
Terror in the eyes of God <br/>


Suffer in Heaven or rule in Hell<br/>
he is the killer, giver of death<br/>
sacrifice is all he needs<br/>
will you surrender at his feet ??<br/>


Kill your god, he is the war <br/>
betrayer of the universe <br/>
demon inside, image of brutality<br/>
he slits your throat, with religion , insanity<br/>
Terror in the eyes of god<br/>
