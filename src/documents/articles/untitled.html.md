The reason this piece is untitled is simple. We couldn’t think of any to fit it in!

This article is about us, by us, for ourselves. 

Among us are the people…

* who do not give a damn which posting it is. “I’m never gonna show my face, no matter what, till I’m in the mood for it”, still managing to know things, sometimes awing the Professors themselves.
* who plan centuries ahead. It doesn’t end here. The execution is done with even more enthusiasm.
* who are rude and who know it. We fight like cats and dogs, but still possess the heart of a child!
* with the cutest smile; so many love us and OMG, we love you too!
* with the talent of “patau”fying any character and winning their hearts.
* who copy in every internal
* who consider copying the questions from their neighbour a sin!

Name it, and we have them with us!

* Be it the ‘ideal students’ or the ones spreading ‘bitti maja’.
* Be it the ones who note down every letter uttered by the teacher or the ones who hit the play button on their daydreams the minute they enter class.
* Be it the calm and cool ones or the ones whose BP is waiting to hit the roof!
* We have the talent to make the sweetest Professors curse us and the crudest ones to smile and  shout, “Yay, let’s do this!”
* Be it the hyperactive ones or the ones too lazy to even breathe
* The ones who spend hours on a date with their mirror and the other extreme - Lord knows when they last combed their hair!
* We have the nerds, we have the ‘othlas’
* When all the onlines turn offline and the night before internals, our “Last seen ages ago” suddenly becomes “online” and “typing…” 

In short, we can never be generalized. Each one is weird: nothing can beat us but our own insanity. 
We are too good to be envied; too evil to be judged.

And we are equally amazed at how all the weirdos landed up together.
