                        <p>It was a rainy Sunday evening and I was standing in my new apartment with my regular evening cup of coffee. I had moved in just last week. Not due to any practical reason, I’m afraid to admit, but because I wanted a change in my life. Since the past year, I felt suffocated in my current state of being. I had a good job, a great family, a fairly nice social life – on the whole, it was a good life. But I was stuck in a rut. I felt like my life was an endless, unbreakable cycle of monotony from which I couldn’t escape. I felt there was something forever missing in my life and I tried in vain to search for that elusive “something”. I was not depressed; just tired of the way I was living. The way I was never really happy and doing things to fill a kind of void in my life.</p>
<p>All these thoughts were going on in my head when I was distracted by a movement outside the window. I turned to see some ladybugs that had just flown in and were sitting motionless on the windowpane. Ladybugs, they always made me smile. They reminded me of my childhood.</p>
<p>My childhood was the most amazing part of my life. I was one of those kids who are difficult to contain, brimming with some wild energy that only comes by virtue of being a child, always fascinated by the world around. I used to be filled with wonder for everything around me, from a pen cap to the universe. Every object was revered with admiration and scrutinized with curiosity. And ladybugs held a special place in that universe of mine. I was constantly struck by how beautiful those creatures were. Their tiny structure, the wings, their hardy yet fragile body and the glorious combination of black and red; every time I would see a ladybug, I would run to catch it and then rush in to show it to my mother. My mother once told me that it almost used to be as if I had caught an angel!</p>
<p>My thoughts were jolted to the present by a thunderclap. And that thunderclap suddenly made me realize what I was missing in life. I was forever looking for a “joie de vivre” that had started deserting me as I was growing up. Nothing filled me with awe anymore and I was always running around in circles trying to figure that out. As I grew up, I left the clichéd “childlike wonder” behind me in order to be a grown-up. No wonder I felt so tired and so jaded and was forever lamenting about that “something” missing in my life. </p>
<p>I sipped on my now cold coffee following this train of thought when suddenly my niece came rushing in. Bubbling up and down with enthusiasm she screamed, “Masi, look! I caught a ladybug!”</p>
